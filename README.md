Data Science Specialization on Coursera; held by Jeff Leek et al, John Hopkins University

The recommended sequence of courses typically is Data Scientist's Toolbox and R Programming, then Getting and Cleaning Data and Exploratory Data Analysis, followed by Reproducible Research by itself, then Statistical Inference and Regression Models if you are comfortable with basic statistics (these courses could easily be 6 weeks rather than 4 weeks in my opinion), otherwise take them individually, next on the agenda would be Practical Machine Learning, followed by Developing Data Products. The specialisation is designed to be completed in 9 months excluding the capstone project course. https://class.coursera.org/datascitoolbox-022/forum/thread?thread_id=273
